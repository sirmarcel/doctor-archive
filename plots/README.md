# `plots`

Dependencies: `xarray[io] numpy scipy matplotlib seaborn`

These scripts are not intended to be runnable, but serve as documentation. Nevertheless, it *should* be possible to run them with a bit of fiddling. They rely on three data sources: The repository for the "gknet" paper, the one for the "glp" paper, and the one for the thesis. So you need to obtain https://github.com/sirmarcel/gknet-archive and https://github.com/sirmarcel/glp-archive in addition to this repository. Then, wherever "gknet" and "glp" are referenced, you need to rewrite the paths to point to the `results/results` and `results/data` subfolders. For the plots that rely on otherwise unpublished data, you need to point to the respective subfolders in this repository instead. Good luck!
